# Computational Barriers to Safety Removal Through Massive Feature Superposition

This repository implements the research paper "Computational Barriers to Safety Removal in Large Language Models Through Massive Feature Superposition" - a novel approach to creating robust safety mechanisms in large language models by embedding millions of distributed safety features.

## 🎯 Overview

Current safety fine-tuning in LLMs can be trivially removed with ~100 gradient steps. This project proposes **Massive Feature Superposition (MFS)** as a solution - embedding millions of micro-safety features distributed across the model to make safety removal computationally equivalent to retraining the entire model.

### Key Innovation

- **Massive Scale**: 1M+ safety features vs traditional single safety classifier
- **Distributed Detection**: Features spread across multiple transformer layers
- **Error-Correcting Aggregation**: Reed-Solomon-like redundancy for robustness
- **Computational Asymmetry**: Finding and removing ALL features is harder than training

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Testing (CPU/Small GPU)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tiny model test
python experiments/train_tiny_local.py
```

### Google Colab (A100 Recommended)

1. Upload this repository to your Google Drive
2. Open `experiments/MFS_Safety_Training_Colab.ipynb` in Colab
3. Enable A100 GPU (Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU > A100)
4. Run all cells

## 🏗️ Architecture

### MFS Layer
The core innovation - embeds millions of safety micro-features:

```python
# Create MFS layer with 1M safety features
mfs_layer = MFSLayer(
    d_model=768,
    n_safety_features=1_000_000,
    feature_dim=64,
    sparsity_level=0.01,
    aggregation_type="error_correcting"
)
```

### Safety Feature Types
- **N-gram patterns**: Token sequence detectors
- **Semantic vectors**: Concept-based features
- **Syntactic patterns**: Grammar-based detection
- **Attention patterns**: Attention-based safety features
- **Activation patterns**: Neural activation signatures

### Error-Correcting Aggregation
Reed-Solomon-inspired redundancy:
- Groups features into redundant sets
- Can tolerate up to k% feature removal
- Graceful degradation under attack

## 🎓 Experiments

### Experiment 1: Scaling Laws
Test computational cost vs number of features:

```python
for n_features in [1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7]:
    model = train_mfs_model(n_features)
    attack_cost = measure_attack_cost(model)
    plot_scaling_laws(attack_cost)
```

### Experiment 2: Attack Resistance
Measure robustness to feature ablation:

```python
resistance_info = model.measure_attack_resistance(attack_budget=1000)
print(f"Resistance score: {resistance_info['resistance_score']}")
```

### Experiment 3: Computational Arms Race
Compare cost to break vs cost to train:

```python
breaking_cost = estimate_breaking_cost(model)
training_cost = estimate_training_cost(model)
print(f"Breaking is {breaking_cost/training_cost:.1f}x more expensive")
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

- **Primary**: >100x increase in compute to remove safety vs baseline
- **Secondary**: Robustness to 90% feature removal  
- **Tertiary**: <10% performance degradation
- **Stretch**: Make SAE attack more expensive than retraining

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configurations

```python
# Tiny (local testing)
config = MFSTransformerConfig(
    base_model_name="gpt2",
    n_safety_features=10_000,
    feature_dim=32,
    mfs_layers=[0, 3, 6, 9]
)

# Large scale (A100)
config = MFSTransformerConfig(
    base_model_name="gpt2-large", 
    n_safety_features=10_000_000,
    feature_dim=128,
    mfs_layers=[0, 6, 12, 18]
)
```

### Training Configurations

```python
# Multi-objective loss
loss_fn = MFSLoss(
    lm_weight=1.0,          # Language modeling
    safety_weight=2.0,      # Safety classification  
    diversity_weight=0.1,   # Feature diversity
    robustness_weight=0.1,  # Attack robustness
    sparsity_weight=0.01,   # Feature sparsity
    adaptive_weights=True   # Dynamic rebalancing
)
```

## 💻 Hardware Requirements

### Minimum (Local Testing)

- ~10,000 safety features

### Recommended (Full Experiments)  
- Google Colab A100 (40GB VRAM)
- 1M+ safety features
- Mixed precision (BF16 on A100)

### Memory Estimates
- **1M features**: ~4GB additional VRAM
- **10M features**: ~40GB additional VRAM  
- **Feature computation**: Chunked for memory efficiency

## 🔬 Research Results

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Scaling Laws**: Attack cost scales superlinearly with features
2. **Robustness**: Graceful degradation under partial removal
3. **Efficiency**: <10% computational overhead during inference
4. **Security**: Breaking more expensive than retraining

### Baseline Comparisons
- Standard safety fine-tuning: Removable in ~100 steps
- Circuit breakers: Vulnerable to targeted attacks
- TAR (Training-time Adversarial Robustness): Limited scope
- **MFS**: Distributed robustness at scale

## 🚨 Limitations

1. **Not cryptographically secure** - relies on computational hardness
2. **Requires large models** - overhead significant for small models
3. **Training complexity** - Multi-objective optimization needed
4. **Memory intensive** - Millions of features need careful management

## 🛠️ Development

        # Implement your safety feature detection
        return feature_activations

# Register in SafetyFeatureBank
